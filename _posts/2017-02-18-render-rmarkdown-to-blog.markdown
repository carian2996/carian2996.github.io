Sharing your analysis can be an excellent way to learn from others and collaborate with your discoveries. 

In this entry you will learn how to do the following:

1. Create a personal web page to store your analysis.
2. Manage and personalize your page.
3. Automatize your analysis to publish it.

Let's start! :grimacing:

## 1. Create a personal web page
Nowadays, create a web page can be really easy. We are going to work on [Github](https://github.com/), that works as host and there we will easy deploy our blog. 

The first thing to do is create an account on Github. You can learn more about Github [here](https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/) and after that, maybe some reading about the Github's core, the really cool project call [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
